# Simple-Calculator
This is creadted by using C#.. Please use visual studio 2012 or higher version to open the coding. You can use debug file or open with VS and run the calculator.
All the necessary codings are embeded. 100% working as a simple calculator. 
Also it can't operate like a scientific calculator.

I have attch some screenshots to see the interface of it.
